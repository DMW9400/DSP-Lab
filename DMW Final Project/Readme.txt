Hello Mason,
My attached code - wt_gen.jpynb - makes minimal use of external libraries, 
and executing all on that document should return the full project.
I used the following libraries:
Numpy
Matplotlib
Soundfile
IPython Display

.Wav files will also be outputted, feel free to throw them into any wavetable synth of your choice!
